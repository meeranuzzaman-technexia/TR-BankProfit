/**
 * Tax already deducted at source reaches a filing from two independent places:
 *
 *   - the salary certificate, which reports Section 149 deductions made by an
 *     employer, and
 *   - the bank ledger, where every Section 151 deduction appears as its own
 *     transaction the wizard classifies as EXPENSE / TAX_PAYMENT.
 *
 * Both have to be counted, because neither contains the other. What makes
 * this awkward is that they *can* overlap: an employer that pays gross salary
 * and deducts tax separately produces a bank row for the same deduction the
 * certificate already reports. Adding them blindly would then invent a refund
 * that does not exist.
 *
 * The rule implemented here is deliberately conservative. The two sources are
 * added, and the result is flagged when the ledger contains a tax row that
 * looks like employer withholding, rather than guessing which side to drop.
 * A wrong refund is far more damaging than a question: the taxpayer files it,
 * and FBR raises the notice months later.
 *
 * Deciding by keyword alone was rejected. Two defects in this codebase already
 * came from reading intent out of bank narration — "IBFT" was treated as proof
 * of an internal transfer, and "HBL" failed to match "Habib Bank Limited".
 * Keywords are used here only to raise a question, never to change a number.
