# TaxRocket Portal Agent - Electron Desktop Agent

This is the trusted desktop agent for FBR IRIS filing as described in `worker.md`.

## Architecture (from worker.md)

- **Main Process** (`main.js`): Creates BrowserWindow with persistent partition `persist:fbr-iris-{partitionKey}`, handles deep link `taxrocket-connect://`, localhost bridge `127.0.0.1:37219`, safeStorage for device token
- **Portal Agent** (`portal-agent.js`): Polls backend `/api/local-agent/jobs/next`, fetches context with portalFieldMap, fills IRIS fields using selectors, handles pause points (OTP, captcha, PIN, PSID, final review), captures screenshots
- **Selector Bundle** (`fbr-agent-config.ts`): DOM selectors for IRIS 2.0 Angular vs Classic PrimeFaces - can be updated without redeploy via DB

## Dev

Normal development starts with live autofill **off**:

```powershell
cd E:\tax-rocket-electron-main\electron-connect
npm run dev
```

For a deliberate supervised real-portal run, use the separate opt-in launcher:

```powershell
cd E:\tax-rocket-electron-main\electron-connect
npm run dev:live
```

`dev:live` sets `TAXROCKET_REAL_AUTOFILL=live` only in the Electron launcher process and restores the previous PowerShell environment when the agent exits. It does not alter the repository `.env` or make ordinary `npm run dev` live. While that Electron agent remains open, eligible queued jobs can run live; close it after the intended supervised retry. Synthetic navigation tests remain separate and do not need FBR login or live mode.

Install dependencies once if they are missing:

```powershell
npm ci
```

## Build

```bash
npm run dist:win
# Output: dist/Tax Rocket Portal Agent Setup.exe
```

## Upload to GCS

```bash
npm run desktop-installer:upload
# Requires GCS_BUCKET_NAME, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

## Flow

1. User in web app clicks "Create Desktop Session" -> gets launchToken + deep link
2. Web triggers `taxrocket-connect://connect?token=xxx&partition=yyy`
3. Electron main.js catches deep link, extracts token, calls `/api/fbr-connect/desktop/register`
4. Electron stores token via safeStorage (encrypted)
5. User logs into IRIS locally in Electron window
6. Electron calls `/api/fbr-connect/desktop/ready`
7. Electron polls `/api/local-agent/jobs/next` every 3s
8. When job found, fetches `/api/local-agent/jobs/{id}/context` -> gets portalFieldMap with IRIS codes (1000, 2001, 500312, 64150301 etc)
9. Fills IRIS fields, captures screenshots, pauses at gates (OTP etc) - sensitive data never leaves local
10. Reports status via `/api/local-agent/jobs/{id}/status`

## Required from Client

- GCS bucket for installer hosting (or use local)
- IRIS selectors for real portal (1000, 2001, 500312, 64020004, 64150301, 64151101 etc)
- Windows code signing cert for production

## Known Issues from worker.md

- Endpoint still named `/api/downloads/dld-connection/windows` but app is `Tax Rocket Portal Agent` - both endpoints now support backward compat
- Classic pause actions `classic_final_review` and `classic_pin_entry` normalized to `final_review` and `pin_required` in backend
- `fbr-connect-client.tsx` was not mounted - FIXED in Phase 1

## New-return setup dialog (TY2026+)

IRIS opens a modal titled "Normal Return (Ind/AOP/COY)" with a prefilled Person box and a Tax
Period box. The agent recognises that caption (`Tax Year`, `Period` or `Tax Period` + exactly one
`Continue`/`Accept and Continue`) and clicks Continue, because nothing is left for a human to
answer. It refuses and leaves a Retry checkpoint when any editable box is still empty, when a
4-digit period names a year other than the packet's, or when the dialog contains a
password/one-time-code field. The Summary of Economic Transactions screen is handled separately:
when the pinned approved packet contains income sources, residency and wealth-statement context,
the agent selects only the exact captured IRIS options and Start Return Filling control. If the
packet is incomplete or the live choices cannot be reconciled, it pauses. It never invents an
answer and never touches Create/Save/Submit.

## Env Vars

```
# THE switch for touching the real portal. Read once per job (main.js:getRealAutofillMode).
#   off  (unset) — navigation only; the agent never resolves or writes a field
#   dry          — locates every IRIS target and reports what it WOULD write; writes nothing
#   live (or 1/true/on/yes) — actually writes, and only into cells whose column header
#                             and section structure were verified by the section tour
TAXROCKET_REAL_AUTOFILL=dry
```

The mode is echoed in every autofill log line (`real_autofill_start`), and a job that
filled 0 fields is reported as such — do not treat `dry` as "the filing worked".

`live` here is only half the switch. The web app decides the other half
(`TAXROCKET_ALLOW_LIVE_FILING`), and this process reads no `.env` at all — exporting the variable
in the shell that launches `npm run dev` is what counts. When the deployment has not opted in, the
agent says so in the job log and runs the job as `dry`. This is not a bug to work around: see
"Two keys are needed…" in the repository README.

One more thing can downgrade it: `taxAutomationConfig.livePilot.automaticFilingEnabled`
is a **deployment kill switch** (`main.js:resolveAutofillMode`). When it is explicitly
`false`, a `live` request runs as `dry` and the job log says so. It never _enables_
writes, and when the field is absent or null the env var decides alone.

Two safety rails are deliberate and should stay:

- **Derived cells are never written.** IRIS computes `Total Income`, `Subject to Final
Tax`, `Subject to Exemption` and `Subject to Normal Tax` itself and renders them
  `disabled`; only the entered column may be filled.
- **A guessed cell is never written in `live`.** If a column can only be located by
  position (`position_fallback` / `sole_editable`), the field is refused as
  `unverified_target`. Set `payload.allowUnverifiedTargets` only for a supervised one-off.
