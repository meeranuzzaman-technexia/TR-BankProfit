 * "the action must read the gaps through the shared helper" — which reads like a broken

 *
 * So this checks presence, not behaviour: every file the current round touched must still
 * contain a string only the current version has. Exact bytes are deliberately not
 * compared — line endings and prettier reflows differ between machines, and a marker
 * survives both, while an old copy cannot fake it.
