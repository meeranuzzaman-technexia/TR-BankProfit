/**
 * Wealth Statement rows the packet may carry (116 → Reconciliation / Assets).
 *
 * Kept apart from `portal-row-evidence.ts`, which is generated from the capture
 * census and must not be hand-edited. Evidence for everything here:
 *  - `+ Expenses` modal ("expense modal IRIS 2.0") and the grid it produces
 *    ("reconciliation with expense fields IRIS 2.0"), captured 2026-10-01.
 *  - "7098 added IRIS 2.0" (2026-10-01): `+` on Adjustments in Outflows takes a
 *    required Description, and after SAVE a SECOND row with the same id 7098
 *    appears ("Adjustments in Outflows - <description>") with ONE editable cell.
 *    (The first 7098 is the disabled summary row, so the filler's duplicate-id
 *    rule picks the editable one.)
 *  - Bank balances are NOT here on purpose: `7012` is "Cash in hand", not a bank
 *    account. Banks are `7030`, added one by one through the Bank Account
 *    modal, which demands an IBAN TaxRocket does not store.
 *
 * Expense child rows do NOT exist until the operator ticks the category in the
 * modal and presses ADD. Each then renders ONE editable amount cell. `label` is
 * the exact checkbox text, so a driver can tick the right box by text.
