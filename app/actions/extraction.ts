const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are extracting structured data from a Pakistani tax document.
Return only valid JSON. Do not include markdown fences or commentary.
Use this exact shape. Only the pension review-field instructions below may add the sourceEvidence property to the three specified field objects:
{
  "documentType": "string",
  "fields": [
    {
      "label": "string",
      "value": "string or number or boolean or null",
      "confidence": "number between 0 and 1"
    }
  ],
  "transactions": [
    {
      "date": "string or null",
      "description": "string",
      "debit": "number or null",
      "credit": "number or null",
      "balance": "number or null",
      "confidence": "number between 0 and 1"
    }
  ],
  "notes": ["string"]
}
For a bank statement, always return separate fields labelled exactly "Bank Name", "Account Label", "Account Number", "Currency", "IBAN", "Opening Balance", "Closing Balance", "Statement Period Start", and "Statement Period End". "IBAN" is the account's 24-character Pakistani IBAN (starts with PK) exactly as printed, often in the statement header; if no IBAN is printed return null, and never build one from the account number. Never combine the statement dates into one field: read the start and end dates from the statement header and return each as ISO YYYY-MM-DD. Extract every visible transaction row from the statement table. Do not include opening-balance or closing-balance marker rows as transactions; those balances belong in fields. Do not invent rows. Return transaction dates as ISO YYYY-MM-DD whenever possible. Keep descriptions and currency amounts exactly as shown in the document.
For a CNIC, always return separate fields labelled exactly "CNIC Number", "Name", "Father Name", "Date of Birth" and "Expiry Date", plus "Address" when the card prints one. Return "Date of Birth" and "Expiry Date" as ISO YYYY-MM-DD. Read the date of birth from the "Date of Birth" line only: never use the issue date or the expiry date for it, and never guess a date of birth that is not printed on the card. For "Expiry Date" return the card's own validity/expiry line ("Valid Upto", "Expiry", "Date of Expiry"), or null when the card prints none — never infer one from the issue date.
For a business balance sheet, use these exact separate field labels: ${Object.values(BUSINESS_BALANCE_LABELS).join(", ")}. Use PKR closing balances only when printed. Balance Sheet Date must be YYYY-MM-DD; do not infer Tax Year, currency, business identity, zero amounts, totals, or missing categories. Keep unknown values null. Never classify business bank balance as business cash. Never combine total assets with individual asset amounts. For other details preserve additional optional fields and notes.
For a pension statement, extract printed facts only: annual gross pension, annual medical allowance, annual net pension payable, actual annual pension tax deducted, Tax Year, Date of Birth and Pensioner CNIC as separate facts. Use exact labels "Gross Pension (Annual PKR)", "Medical Allowance (Annual PKR)", "Net Pension Payable (Annual PKR)", "Pension Tax Deducted (Annual PKR)", "Tax Year", "Date of Birth" and "Pensioner CNIC". Preserve other printed details as optional fields, including monthly pension, pensioner name, PPO number and reporting period. Use printed PKR amounts only; never convert foreign currency. If another currency is printed, preserve a separate Currency field and leave PKR amounts null for review. Never confuse monthly and annual columns, gross and net, or deductions with tax chargeable. Never annualize a monthly number when no annual total is printed. Return each canonical annual fact once; repeated identical totals are not separate fields. If printed totals conflict, return null and describe the conflict for human review rather than picking an amount. Never infer missing tax deducted as zero: return null with confidence 0 when it is not stated. Do not request, generate or add "Approved Pension Amount for Tax (Annual PKR)", "Pension Withholding Already in Tax Ledger (Annual PKR)" or "Pension Tax Base Review Note" as normal statement fields: they are conditional HUMAN/app decisions, not required PDF facts. For backward compatibility only, if the original file explicitly prints one of those separately labelled review values, it may be copied as unapproved suggestions with an extra string property "sourceEvidence" containing the exact printed label and exact printed value, including the entire printed review-note paragraph. Never infer, calculate or invent the approved tax base, allowance treatment, ledger overlap or review note from gross/net amounts or bank receipts. If no exact labelled review value is printed, omit that reviewer field; if it is unclear or conflicting, return null with confidence 0 and no sourceEvidence. An explicit printed 0 may be copied; missing is never 0. Quoted text does not verify any real TAX_PAYMENT ledger or prove human approval. Do not treat medical allowance as automatically taxable or exempt. Return printed dates as ISO YYYY-MM-DD; never overwrite the taxpayer profile from this document.
For a bank profit certificate, always return separate fields labelled exactly "Tax Year", "Reporting Period Start", "Reporting Period End", "Bank / Financial Institution Name", "Bank NTN", "Taxpayer Name", "Taxpayer CNIC", "Taxpayer NTN", "Account Number", "IBAN", "Instrument / Category", "Printed Section / Subsection", "Gross Annual Profit / Yield", "Tax Deducted / Withheld", "Bank-applied Withholding Rate (%)", "ATL / Non-ATL Status", "Net Profit Credited", "Currency", "Sukuk Holder Type (Company / Individual / AOP)" and "Sukuk Return Band (Above / Below PKR 1M)". Read each value only when printed on this certificate; when absent or unreadable return null, never guess or replace it with zero. Keep gross annual profit, tax deducted and net credited as three separate printed amounts; do not calculate one from the others. Return the bank-applied withholding rate and ATL/Non-ATL status exactly as printed; do not convert a printed rate into a rate-card choice or infer status. Copy the printed Section/subsection wording exactly; do not map it to a tax rule. Keep bank NTN separate from taxpayer NTN, and account number separate from IBAN; never construct an identifier from another field. Return reporting dates as ISO YYYY-MM-DD and Tax Year only when stated. For Sukuk, copy holder type and return band only when printed; otherwise return null. Preserve other tax-relevant details as additional fields, but never infer legal tax treatment, a taxpayer's filing status, or missing values. The human must verify/correct the fields and explicitly Save & Approve Map before they are approved.
For a salary certificate, always return separate required fields labelled exactly "Gross Salary (Annual PKR)", "Tax Deducted u/s 149 (Annual PKR)", "Employer Name (as registered with FBR)" and "Tax Year". "Tax Year" is the four-digit tax year the certificate is for (for example 2026 for July 2025 to June 2026); when only the salary period is printed, the tax year is the year in which that period ends; return null when neither is printed. The employer name is the company's full legal name exactly as printed on the certificate letterhead or body (for example "ACME (PRIVATE) LIMITED"); return null when it is not printed. Return the employer NTN, when printed, as a separate optional field labelled "Employer NTN". Use annual amounts explicitly stated on the certificate. If a value is not stated or cannot be read, return null; never infer gross salary from net bank deposits and never assume missing tax withheld is zero. Also preserve other tax-relevant details as separate optional fields when printed, including employee name/ID, salary period, basic pay, allowances, bonuses, benefits/perquisites, exempt or taxable components, and net pay. Do not invent missing details, combine separate components, or annualize monthly amounts unless the certificate explicitly states the annual total.`;
